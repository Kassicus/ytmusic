### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ytmusic
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Convert the SVG icon to PNG:

   ```

### Building for Distribution

#### Option 1: Simple Build (Recommended)
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build-simple
   ```

2. Create installer packages:
   ```bash
   .\create-installer.ps1
   ```

This creates:
- `YouTube Music Desktop Portable.zip` - Portable version (extract and run)
- `YouTube Music Desktop Installer.zip` - Installer version (extract and run install.bat as admin)

#### Option 2: Advanced Build
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Create distributable packages:
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```

The built applications will be available in the `dist` folder.

### Project Structure

```
ytmusic/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js          # Main Electron process
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ preload.js       # Preload script for security

### Key Components

- **main.js**: Handles the Electron app lifecycle, window management, and media key registration
- **preload.js**: Provides secure APIs for the renderer process
- **Media Key Integration**: Uses Electron's `globalShortcut` API to capture system media keys

### Media Key Implementation

The app uses JavaScript injection to interact with YouTube Music's web interface:

1. **Play/Pause**: Finds and clicks the play/pause button
2. **Track Navigation**: Clicks next/previous buttons
3. **Volume Control**: Manipulates the volume slider directly

### Security Features

- Context isolation enabled
- Node integration disabled
- Web security enabled
- Secure IPC communication
- External links opened in default browser

## Troubleshooting
